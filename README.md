Selenium can't handle captcha. While website using captcha for the same reason so no one can automate their website using any robots. There is some 3rd party libraries are present who claim that they can automate captcha too but I never tried and heard that they are not efficient too. Even the tesseract library does not work 100%.

Solution : developers can provide special environment where they bypass that captcha features.
